# Uber Data Analysis and Visualization  

## Project Overview  
This project analyzes Uber ride data to understand user behavior, booking trends, and ride preferences. By performing data analysis and visualization in **Google Colab**, the project answers key questions such as the most popular ride categories, purposes, peak booking times, seasonal trends, and ride distances. The results provide valuable insights into Uberâ€™s usage patterns and user preferences.  

## Tools and Technologies  
- **Environment:** Google Colab  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries Used:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  

## Objectives  
- Analyze the dataset to identify patterns in ride bookings.  
- Generate clear visualizations to answer specific questions.  
- Extract actionable insights to understand user behavior.  

## Steps to Run the Project  
1. Open the `Uber_Data_Analysis_Using_Python.ipynb` file in **Google Colab**.  
2. Upload the dataset:  
   - Use the Colab file upload feature or add the dataset via code.  
3. Ensure the required libraries are installed using `!pip install`.  
4. Run the notebook cells sequentially to process the data and visualize insights.  

## Preprocessing Steps  
1. Upload and load the dataset into a DataFrame.  
2. Handle missing values by filling or removing them.  
3. Remove duplicate rows to ensure data accuracy.  
4. Standardize column names and convert data types as needed.  
5. Drop unnecessary columns to focus on relevant data.  

## Key Questions Answered  
1. Which category of rides (e.g., Business, Personal) do users book the most?  
2. For what purposes do users primarily book Uber rides?  
3. At what time of day are Uber rides booked the most?  
4. In which months are Uber rides booked less frequently?  
5. On which days of the week are bookings the highest?  
6. What is the average distance users book rides for?  

## Visualizations  
- **Bar Charts:** Compare categories and purposes of rides.  
- **Line Graphs:** Show time-based and day-based trends.  
- **Heatmaps:** Analyze weekly or monthly booking patterns.  

## Results  
The analysis uncovers trends in Uber bookings, including popular ride categories, frequent booking times, and travel distances. These insights can help businesses understand customer preferences and improve their services.
